# Botcoins v1 (Deprecated)
I am aware the code in this repository is not neat or anything, so don't hold me against it.

The code in this repository won't be maintained, either, so don't bother me with issues / PR. If you are looking to contribute to Botcoins v2, check the discord link in https://botcoins.github.io/v2-docs

This branch is the last version of Botcoins before all the code that interacts with external apis removed. It may run but not correctly.

## Currently known (wontfix) bugs:
* Unirest may fail
* Ridiculously high memory consumption
* Websocket randomly disconnects and doesn't sync properly
